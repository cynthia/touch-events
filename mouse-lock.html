    <section id='abstract'>
      This specification defines an API that provides scripted access to raw
      mouse movement data while locking the target of mouse events to a single
      element and removing the cursor from view.  This is an essential input
      mode for certain classes of applications, especially first person
      perspective 3D applications and 3D modelling software.
    </section>

    <section id='introduction' class='informative'>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The Mouse Lock API provides for input methods of applications based on 
      the movement of the mouse, not just the absolute position of a cursor.  A 
      popular example is that of first person movement controls in three 
      dimensional graphics applications such as games.  Movement of the mouse is 
      interpreted for rotation of the view-port, there is no limit to how far 
      movement can go, and no mouse cursor is displayed.</p>
      
      <p>Mouse Lock is related to Mouse Capture [MDCCAP].  Capture provides 
      continued event delivery to a target element while a mouse is being 
      dragged, but ceases when the mouse button is released.  Mouse Lock differs 
      by being persistent, not limited by screen boundaries, sending events 
      regardless of mouse button state, hiding the cursor, and not releasing 
      until an API call or specific release gesture by the user.</p>

    <section id='conformance'>
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
        product: the <dfn id="dfn-user-agent">user agent</dfn> that implements
        the interfaces that it contains.
      </p>

      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
        this specification MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the
        ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]] as
        this specification uses that specification and terminology.
      </p>

      <p>
        A conforming implementation is required to implement all fields
        defined in this specification.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2><a>Document</a> Interface extension</h2>
      <p>
        The <a>Document</a> interface [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-CORE]] contains methods
        providing the ability to enter, exit, and poll the state of mouse lock.
      </p>

      <dl title='partial interface Document' class='idl'>
        <dt>void lockMouse()</dt>
        <dd>
          The <a>lockMouse</a>() method requests that the mouse be locked to a 
          given DOM element <a>target</a>. It must immediately return. Two 
          optional callback parameters provide asynchronous notification of 
          success <a>successCallback</a> or failure <a>failureCallback</a> to 
          acquire the locked state. The user agent must determine if mouse lock 
          state will be entered and call the appropriate callback if it was 
          provided. Because a user agent may prompt a user for permission to 
          enter mouse lock the response must be asynchronous.
