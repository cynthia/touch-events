          touching area (e.g. finger, stylus) along the x-axis, in pixels of
          the same scale as <a>screenX</a>; <code>1</code> if no value is

        <dd>
          the radius of the ellipse which most closely circumscribes the

          the same scale as <a>screenY</a>; <code>1</code> if no value is

        <dd>
          a relative value of pressure applied, in the range <code>0</code> to
          <code>1</code>, where <code>0</code> is no pressure, and
          <code>1</code> is the highest level of pressure the touch device is
          capable of sensing; <code>0</code> if no value is known.  In
          environments where <a>force</a> is known, the absolute pressure
          represented by the <a>force</a> attribute, and the sensitivity in
          levels of pressure, may vary.
