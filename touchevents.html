      The Touch Interface specification defines a set of low-level events that represent one or more points of contact with a touch-sensitive surface, and changes of those points with respect to the surface and any DOM elements displayed upon it (e.g. for touch screens) or associated with it (e.g. for drawing tablets without displays).  It also addresses pen-tablet devices, such as drawing tablets, with consideration toward stylus capabilities.

    <section id='conformance'>

      <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single product: the <dfn id="dfn-user-agent">user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that it contains. </p>

      <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in this specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]] as this specification uses that specification and terminology.  </p>

      <p> A conforming implementation is required to implement all fields defined in this specification. </p>

          the radius of the ellipse which most closely circumscribes the touching area (e.g. finger, stylus) along the x-axis, in pixels of the same scale as <a>screenX</a>; <code>1</code> if no value is known.

        </dd>
        <dt>readonly attribute long radiusY</dt>
        <dd>
          the radius of the ellipse which most closely circumscribes the touching area (e.g. finger, stylus) along the y-axis, in pixels of the same scale as <a>screenY</a>; <code>1</code> if no value is known.
        </dd>

        <dt>readonly attribute float rotationAngle</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            the angle (in degrees) that the ellipse described by <a>radiusX</a>
            and <a>radiusY</a> is rotated clockwise about its center;
            <code>0</code> if no value is known.  The value must be greater
            than or equal to <code>0</code> and less than <code>90</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the ellipse described by <a>radiusX</a> and <a>radiusY</a> is
            circular, then <a>rotationAngle</a> has no effect.  The user agent
            may use <code>0</code> as the value in this case, or it may use any
            other value in the allowed range.  (For example, the user agent may
            use the <a>rotationAngle</a> value from the previous touch event,
            to avoid sudden changes.)
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>readonly attribute float force</dt>
        <dd>
          a relative value of pressure applied, in the range <code>0</code> to <code>1</code>, where <code>0</code> is no pressure, and <code>1</code> is the highest level of pressure the touch device is capable of sensing; <code>0</code> if no value is known.  In environments where <a>force</a> is known, the absolute pressure represented by the <a>force</a> attribute, and the sensitivity in levels of pressure, may vary.

        <p>If the values of <a>radiusX</a>, <a>radiusY</a>, <a>rotationAngle</a>, or <a>force</a> are known, then the user agent also must dispatch this event type to indicate when any of these attributes of a <a>touch point</a> have changed.</p>

A user agent may also dispatch this event type when the user places more <a>touch point</a>s on the touch surface than the device or implementation is configured to store, in which case the earliest <a>TouchPoint</a> object in the <a>TouchList</a> should be removed.</p>
